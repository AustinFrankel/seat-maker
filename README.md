# Seat Maker

Create seating for events.

## What this affects

Only www.seatmakerapp.com will switch from GitHub Pages (where your app-ads.txt lives). It wonâ€™t affect mail/MX, SPF, or other records.

If you still want visitors to see your Google Site, you can add an index.html in this repo that redirects www to your Google Sites URL while keeping /app-ads.txt on your domain. Provide the Sites URL and we can commit it.
